# Elite Dangerous Keybindings
This repository contains custom keybindings for the game Elite Dangerous.
I'm using Trustmaster SOL-r2 HOSAS setup.

# Path to Keybindings on CachyOS and Steam
Path may vary depending on your operating system and installation method. You may use the following general path structure for Steam Proton installations:

`~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/359320/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Local Settings/Application Data/Frontier Developments/Elite Dangerous/Options/Bindings/`

In my case, the keybindings are located at:

`/home/ricardo/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/359320/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Local Settings/Application Data/Frontier Developments/Elite Dangerous/Options/Bindings`
